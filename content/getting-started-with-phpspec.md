I recently wrote a detailed getting started tutorial for [phpspec](http://phpspec.net/). It's now online over at [Tuts+](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-phpspec--cms-20919)!

In the tutorial, we build the foundation of a todo list application, using a SpecBDD approach. I really, really like phpspec. It's just such a great tool! I hope you'll feel the same way after reading my tutorial.
